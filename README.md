# Sick of Optifine XD

_Have you ever wanted to use a resource pack that depends on <font color=#882d2d >**Optifine**</font> but didn’t want to actually use <font color=#882d2d >**Optifine**</font>?_

## What does this modpack do?

This Modpack is built to run <font color=#882d2d >**Optifine**</font>’s features (especially HD Textures, Connected Textures, Random Mobs, and more) without needing <font color=#882d2d >**Optifine**</font>!

In some cases, **it even goes a step+ further!**

Of course, it also includes plenty of essential performance optimizations and other alternative features to <font color=#882d2d >**Optifine**</font>. However, if you’re looking for even more optimization, you might want to check out the excellent modpacks offered by [SkywardMC](https://modrinth.com/organization/skywardmc).

## How to play with this modpack?

This modpack is basically intended to be played using [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/download/) or the [Modrinth Launcher (App)](https://modrinth.com/app).

Additionally, with the included [Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/resourcify), you can explore new resource packs and attractive shaders within the game!

## Are you used to the Vanilla experience?

This Modpack makes an effort to preserve the **Vanilla mechanics as much as possible**, only introducing bug-fix mods that are either visually impactful or significantly important.

## Q&A

### Q: Why did you make this?

#### A: I wasn't satisfied with the modpacks we currently have.

### Q: Why isn’t [Mod Name] included?

#### A: In most cases, you might be referring to other QOL (Quality of Life) mods, but since my main focus is to run various resource packs, those mods probably won’t be added.<br>However, if you think there’s a mod that would be more suitable for this modpack, please feel free to submit an issue.

### Q: How about ``Canvas`` and ``JMX``?

#### A: ``Canvas`` and ``JMX`` use a rendering API called FREX, which is not widely used and lacks compatibility with many mods. Therefore, we have determined that including them in the modpack is difficult.

<summary>Case 2 -> <b>Emissive trim does not work</b></summary>

<details>
<summary>Case 3 -> <b>UltimaCraft (-1.6)</b></summary>

</br>

[**UltimaCraft**](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/ultimacraft-main)

### Solution

**1**, Extract the relevant Resourcepack.<br>
**2**, Create a folder `polytone/block_modifiers` in `assets/minecraft/`.<br>
**3**, Move (copy) the contents of `assets/minecraft/optifine/colormap` to the folder created in 2.

※You can use Vanadium, but it’s quite buggy and not highly recommended.
